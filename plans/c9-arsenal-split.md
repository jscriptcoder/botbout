## ⏱ Status / Resume (updated 2026-06-29, S6 closeout) — READ FIRST

**This is the single active C9 tracker.** (The Slice 1–2 detail plan
`c9-arsenal-foundation.md` was deleted on closeout — its record is in PRs #67/#68; its
durable learnings are folded in below.)

- ✅ **Slice 1 — band-legality gate** — MERGED (PR #67). `MoveSpec.bands?: Band[]` +
  `bandLegal` intake guard at both move-start sites; an out-of-band `attack` degrades to
  idle. Absent `bands` ⇒ unrestricted (byte-identical); `[]` ⇒ always fizzles.
- ✅ **Slice 2 — `kizami-zuki` jab** — MERGED (PR #68). `MoveId = "strike" | "kizami-zuki"`;
  `MOVES` allowlist (TCB) admits it; `Rules.moves` gains optional `"kizami-zuki"?`. Both
  attack-start sites capture `const spec` once + guard `spec !== undefined` ⇒ an attack
  naming an **unconfigured** move degrades to idle (inert, like sweep/throw).
- ✅ **Slice 3 — `gyaku-zuki` reverse punch** — MERGED (PR #70). `MoveId += "gyaku-zuki"`;
  `MOVES` allowlist + optional `Rules.moves["gyaku-zuki"]`. Established the **reach hierarchy
  `jab(150k) < reverse(200k)`** (`high·mid`, score 1). Confirmed the **mechanical** reality of
  S3+: ZERO `sim.ts` change (the resolver is generic post-S2) — the genuine RED drivers are
  the validator-accept tests (the `MOVES` TCB) + `tsc` (the union + `Rules.moves` key); the
  `runFight` tests are green-from-start (esbuild strips types) and stand as the behavior spec
  + end-to-end mutation coverage. Scoped Stryker on the `MOVES` allowlist: 100% (4/4).
- ✅ **Slice 4 — `mae-geri` front kick** — MERGED (PR #71). `MoveId += "mae-geri"`; `MOVES` +
  optional `Rules.moves["mae-geri"]`. First **single-band** move (`bands:["mid"]` ⇒ the gate
  rejects **both** high and low) + first **2-point (*waza-ari*)** strike (`score 2` flows
  through `computeStrike`'s `spec.score` — no cap, zero resolver code), `reach > reverse`.
  Mechanical (no `sim.ts` change). Scoped Stryker on `MOVES`: 100% (5/5).
- ✅ **Slice 5 — `mawashi-geri` roundhouse + band-dependent score** — MERGED (PR #72). The
  **first non-mechanical** arsenal slice: added `MoveSpec.scoreByBand?: Partial<Record<Band,
  number>>` + the one `computeStrike` line (`baseScore = spec.scoreByBand?.[st.band] ??
  spec.score`). Roundhouse: longest reach, slowest, `high·mid`, jodan 3 / chudan 2 (the okizeme
  finish stays band-agnostic). AC-1 (high = 3) was the genuine resolver RED. Scoped Stryker:
  `sim.ts` baseScore 9/9, `dsl.ts` MOVES 6/6 — both 100%.
- ✅ **Slice 6 — cross-move cancels (rekka routes)** — MERGED (PR #73). A **tests-only proof
  slice** — the C6 cancel machinery is move-agnostic, so cross-move routes already work with
  ZERO production change. Permanent behavior `runFight` tests lock in: cross-move cancel
  resolves (jab→reverse), the no-feint property (a whiffed opener never opens the window), route
  restriction (a configured-but-unlisted move is refused), and a 3-move chain (jab→reverse→
  roundhouse). Scoped Stryker confirmed the cancel machinery stays 100% under the cross-move
  tests. **Deferred (folded into Slice 7 — see below): the `sim.ts:365` cancel-guard survivor.**
- ◐ **Slice 7 — canonical wiring + retire `strike` (the C9 FINALE) — IN PROGRESS.** `planning` +
  `find-gaps` DONE → split into **three PR-sized sub-slices**, detailed in
  `plans/c9-canonical-arsenal.md` (the active S7 plan; all 6 find-gaps decisions resolved there —
  workhorse = `gyaku-zuki`, richer cancel web + sweep→reverse finisher, punch=basic/kick=special
  gas split, mechanical bot swap, docs ride S7.3, order 7.1→7.2→7.3):
    - ✅ **S7.1 — cancel·knockdown hardening** (this PR). A KILL-MUTANTS slice (no production
      change): two `runFight` tests prove a fighter knocked DOWN the same tick it lands a cancelable
      hit (a strike∥sweep trade) stays prone — its `cancelInto` follow-up is refused. **Kills the
      `sim.ts:365` survivor** (`f.state.kind === "attacking"`); scoped Stryker `sim.ts:360–378` now
      leaves only the 2 documented EQUIVALENTS (`:367` `action.type==="attack"`→`true`, `:373`
      `cancelInto ?? []`→`["Stryker was here"]`).
    - ▶ **S7.2 — wire the 4 techniques into `CANONICAL_RULES`** (branch `feat/c9-canonical-arsenal`).
      Additive (`strike` stays): reach hierarchy `throw<sweep<jab<reverse<front<roundhouse`, the
      punch=basic/kick=special gas split, the richer `cancelInto` web — every number proven by a
      *relationship* test in `rules.test.ts` (no literals-in-isolation).
    - ◯ **S7.3 — retire `strike` + reconcile docs** (branch `feat/c9-retire-strike`). The breaking
      migration: remove `strike` from `MoveId`/`Rules.moves`/`MOVES` (TCB)/`CANONICAL_RULES`, migrate
      every fixture/test/CLI/`bots/` onto `gyaku-zuki`, reconcile `docs/BOT-DSL.md` + `docs/DESIGN.md`.
      On merge: **C9 complete** — delete both this tracker and `plans/c9-canonical-arsenal.md`.

**Per-technique pattern (established S2 — S3/S4 were purely mechanical):** to add a technique:
(1) extend the `MoveId` union (`types.ts`); (2) add it to the `MOVES` allowlist
(`dsl.ts` — the **TCB**, keep at 100% mutation); (3) add the optional
`"<id>"?: MoveSpec` key to `Rules.moves` (`types.ts`); (4) configure it in a **test
fixture** (NOT `CANONICAL_RULES` — canonical wiring is Slice 7); (5) `runFight` behavior
tests (in-reach scores · out-of-band fizzles via the Slice-1 gate · beyond-reach whiffs ·
unconfigured ⇒ inert). For S2–S4 the `sim.ts` resolver handled all of this generically —
**no resolver change**. **S5 (`mawashi-geri`) breaks the pure-mechanical streak**: it adds
band-dependent score (additive `scoreByBand?` + the one `computeStrike` `baseScore` line) —
the first genuine RED `runFight` test since the arsenal began. **Cross-move cancels** (S6 —
`cancelInto` routes between distinct moves) shipped as a tests-only proof (zero production
change — the C6 machinery is move-agnostic). Only **S7 — canonical wiring + retire `strike`**
remains. `dsl.ts` reader/validator at 100%;
`sim.ts` changed-line 100% (one documented equivalent on the C6 `cancelInto ?? []` fallback).
Validator scope: it accepts any valid `move`+`band`; the runtime gate decides legality (no
static out-of-band reject). `scoreByBand` is trusted Rules data ⇒ NOT validator-checked.

## Parent

**Actor:** the LLM bot author (and, downstream, anyone watching/replaying a fight).
**Capability:** choose among **distinct named WKF techniques** with real trade-offs
(reach / speed / score / stamina cost / legal height-bands + cross-move cancel routes)
instead of one abstract `strike`.
**Outcome:** spacing, height-reads, and combos become genuine decisions — the
read-game the perception keystone + height bands set up finally has an arsenal to
play it with.
**Current constraint:** too large for one PR — it touches the TCB allowlist
(`dsl.ts`), the `MoveId`/`MoveSpec`/`Rules.moves` contract (`types.ts`), the resolver
(`sim.ts`), and `CANONICAL_RULES` (`rules.ts`); and it introduces two genuinely new
engine behaviors (the band-legality gate; band-dependent score). Must land
**additively, preserving green tests** — the abstract `strike` is scaffolding,
retired only in the final slice.

## Recommended First Slice

**Out-of-band attacks fizzle + the bot can throw the jab (`kizami-zuki`).** Introduce
the multi-move schema (the `MoveId` union, record-keyed `Rules.moves`, `MoveSpec.bands`,
and the `MOVES` allowlist as the roster) and the **band-legality runtime gate** (an
`attack` whose `band ∉ move.bands` degrades to `idle`), proven end-to-end by adding the
first named technique — the jab: short reach, `high·mid`, fast, cheap, 1 point —
**alongside** the still-present abstract `strike`.

**Why this first:** it burns the integration/architecture risk early (the TCB
boundary + the contract reshape + the one new resolver behavior, all in one thin
end-to-end whole), and it makes `bands[]` real — without the gate, `bands[]` is dead
data (a horizontal slice). After it, every remaining technique is a thin additive
slice. Demonstrable on canonical: a bot's `kizami-zuki` scores at `mid`, fizzles to
`idle` at `low`; all existing `strike` tests stay green.

> Thinner alternative (planning's call): ship the bare gate first against a
> `bands`-restricted `strike` (CANONICAL stays byte-identical until a move restricts
> bands), then the jab. Splits "the gate mechanic" from "the union expansion" into two
> even smaller TDD increments. Recommended only if the combined PR feels too big.

## Split Candidates

| # | Slice (child story) | Value | Includes | Defers | Acceptance examples | Release |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 ✅ | **Out-of-band attacks fizzle (band-legality gate)** + multi-move schema [MERGED #67] | Height becomes a per-move constraint (you can't strike a band a move can't reach); the foundation the rest rests on | `MoveSpec.bands: Band[]`; `MoveId` becomes a union; `Rules.moves` record-keyed (sweep stays optional); `MOVES` allowlist = the roster; intake degrades an out-of-band `attack` → `idle` (no startup/spend/score) | Telemetry emission on fizzle (telemetry object NOT YET BUILT); per-move score>1; band-dependent score | Given a move with `bands:["high","mid"]`, When a bot attacks `low`, Then it is `idle` (no commitment, no stamina spend). Within-band attack resolves exactly as today (byte-identical) | Shippable; inert on CANONICAL until a move restricts bands |
| 2 ✅ | **Bot can throw the jab (`kizami-zuki`)** [MERGED #68] | First real technique: a fast, cheap, short-range high/mid poke — a distinct opener | `kizami-zuki` MoveSpec (short reach < strike, `["high","mid"]`, score 1, low staminaCost, own startup/active/recovery); added to roster + allowlist + a test rules fixture; demonstrates slice 1's gate on a real move | Reach hierarchy vs other moves; canonical wiring of jab numbers | Given canonical+jab fixture, When the bot lands `kizami-zuki` at `mid` in range, Then +1 point; When it attacks `low`, Then `idle`; When out of (short) reach, Then whiff | Shippable; jab present alongside `strike` |
| 3 ✅ | **Bot can throw the reverse punch (`gyaku-zuki`)** [MERGED #70] | A longer-range, more-committed second opener → a real reach/speed spacing choice between two punches | `gyaku-zuki` MoveSpec (reach > jab, slower/more recovery, `["high","mid"]`, score 1, higher staminaCost); establishes the **reach hierarchy** jab < reverse | The kicks; band-dependent score | Given jab reach < reverse reach, When the bot is at a gap only the reverse reaches, Then jab whiffs and reverse hits. Reverse's longer recovery is whiff-punishable per the master inequality | Shippable |
| 4 ✅ | **Bot can throw the front kick (`mae-geri`)** [MERGED #71] | First single-band move + first 2-point (waza-ari) strike; deeper reach than punches | `mae-geri` MoveSpec (reach > punches, `["mid"]` only, score 2, kick-tier staminaCost); the gate now bites at **both** high and low | Band-dependent score; canonical re-tune | Given `mae-geri bands:["mid"]`, When attacked `high` or `low`, Then `idle`; When landed `mid` in range, Then +2 | Shippable |
| 5 ✅ | **Bot can throw the roundhouse (`mawashi-geri`) for band-dependent points** [MERGED #72] | The risk/reward apex: longest reach, slowest, costliest; **3 jodan / 2 chudan** — aiming high is worth ippon but easier to block / whiffs a croucher | `mawashi-geri` MoveSpec (longest reach, slowest, highest staminaCost, `["high","mid"]`); introduces **band-dependent score** (the only new mechanic here — see parking lot for shape) | Cross-move cancels; canonical re-tune | Given roundhouse, When landed `high`, Then +3; When landed `mid`, Then +2; When attacked `low`, Then `idle`. A high roundhouse is blocked by a `high` guard / whiffs a croucher | Shippable |
| 6 ✅ | **Bot can chain techniques via cross-move cancels** [MERGED #73] | Combos: a hit-confirmed technique cancels into a *different* one (the rekka routes) — within-exchange escalation across the roster | Canonical `cancelInto` routes between distinct moves (e.g. jab→reverse→roundhouse); a `runFight` proof that cross-move cancel resolves and preserves the **no-feint / connect-required** property (whiff/parry never opens it) | The exact tuned route table (canonical-content, lands here or in slice 7) | Given a jab that connects with jab.cancelInto⊇[reverse], When the bot returns `gyaku-zuki` within `cancelWindow`, Then recovery is interrupted into it; When the jab whiffed, Then the cancel is ignored | Shippable |
| 7 | **Platform fights the arsenal: canonical wiring + stamina re-tune + retire `strike`** | The platform (`npm run fight`, future API/viewer) fights real karate on the 4-strike roster; the abstract `strike` scaffold is gone | Wire all 4 techniques into `CANONICAL_RULES` (reaches `throw<sweep<jab<reverse<front<roundhouse` around the locked anchors; per-move staminaCost cheap-jab→expensive-roundhouse); re-prove the gas band `basic ≤ gasThreshold < special` and the master inequalities by relationship tests; **remove `strike`** from `MoveId`/`moves`/allowlist; migrate engine `getMockRules`/fixtures off `strike` | Match structure, air-actions, telemetry (separate roadmap items) | Given CANONICAL_RULES, the relationship tests hold (every committed startup ≥ lAct+1; reach hierarchy; gas band); `strike` is no longer a valid `MoveId`; full suite green | Shippable — C9 complete |

## Resolved (session 2026-06-29)

- **Move-id naming → Japanese** (`kizami-zuki`, `gyaku-zuki`, `mae-geri`,
  `mawashi-geri`). Reconcile BOT-DSL.md's illustrative `jab`/`kick`/`roundhouse`
  examples in slice 1's doc refresh.
- **Band-dependent score → additive optional `MoveSpec.scoreByBand?: Partial<Record<Band,
  number>>`** (overrides the flat `score` per band; only `mawashi-geri` sets it →
  byte-identical preserved). Lands in slice 5.
- **Gate semantics → runtime-degrade-to-idle.** An `attack` whose resolved `band ∉
  move.bands` degrades to `idle` at runtime (band is often a dynamic DSL expression).
  Slice 1 does **runtime-only**; a literal-band static validator reject is an optional
  later hardening (BOT-DSL.md:138), not slice-1 scope.
- **find-gaps cadence → per story.** Run `find-gaps` on each slice's plan after
  `planning`, before TDD — starting with Slice 1.

## Parking Lot — remaining decisions for `planning`

1. **`strike` retirement timing.** Keep the abstract `strike` through slices 1–6 (so
   every prior test stays green) and remove it only in slice 7. Confirmed by the
   "additively, preserving green tests" design constraint — flagged so planning doesn't
   rename early.
2. **`Rules.moves` shape.** `Partial<Record<MoveId, MoveSpec>>` vs explicit optional
   keys (today: `{ strike; sweep? }`). The roster grows additively; sweep + (interim)
   strike stay optional. Pin the exact type in slice 1.
3. **Reach magnitudes.** Locked anchors: `throw 120k < sweep 180k < strike 240k`. The 4
   strikes slot a hierarchy around 240k (e.g. jab < reverse ≈ old-strike < front <
   roundhouse). Keep new-move numbers in per-slice **test fixtures** until slice 7's
   canonical re-tune (mirrors how C10 kept costs in fixtures until its canonical-wiring
   unit) — avoids re-tuning canonical on every slice.

## Warnings

- **Don't ship `bands[]` as data without the gate** (slice 1) — that's a horizontal
  slice (dead field, no behavior). The field and the rule are one indivisible increment.
- **These are capabilities, not component tasks.** Each technique slice is a new
  tactical option (passes the "real actor" check: actor = bot author / fight outcome),
  not "add a row to the table." Resist relabeling them as schema chores.
- **Don't force canonical re-tuning into every slice.** New moves live in test fixtures
  per slice; CANONICAL changes once, in slice 7 — keeps each slice's blast radius small
  and the relationship tests stable.
- **TCB caution (slice 1).** The `MOVES` allowlist in `dsl.ts` IS the security boundary
  for `attack.move`. Expanding it to the union is the load-bearing TCB change — keep the
  `dsl.ts` interpreter at 100% mutation as the prior slices did.
- Slice 6 (cross-move cancel) depends on ≥2 techniques (slices 2–3). All others are
  linearly additive; order 1→7 is the natural dependency chain.

## Next Step

**Slice 7 — canonical wiring + retire `strike` (the C9 FINALE).** Branch `feat/c9-canonical-arsenal`.
This is the **only remaining C9 slice** — Slices 1–6 are merged (#67/#68/#70/#71/#72/#73). It is
substantial (canonical re-tune + a breaking `strike` removal + docs), so run `planning` to split it
into PR-sized increments, then `find-gaps` on that plan, before TDD. Scope:
1. **Wire all 4 techniques into `CANONICAL_RULES`** (`rules.ts`): reach hierarchy
   `throw<sweep<jab<reverse<front<roundhouse` around the locked anchors (`throw 120k < sweep 180k <
   strike 240k`); per-move `staminaCost` (cheap jab → expensive roundhouse, preserving the gas band
   `basic ≤ gasThreshold < special`); the canonical `cancelInto` route table (the rekka routes proven
   in S6). Re-prove every number by a *relationship* test in `rules.test.ts` (master inequalities +
   gas band + reach hierarchy — no literals-in-isolation).
2. **Retire the abstract `strike`**: remove it from `MoveId` (`types.ts`), `Rules.moves` (`types.ts`),
   and the `MOVES` allowlist (`dsl.ts` — the TCB); migrate every engine `getMockRules`/fixture and the
   existing `runFight`/`rules` tests off `strike` onto a real technique. This is the breaking change —
   expect broad test churn; keep the suite green at each increment.
3. **Reconcile docs**: `docs/BOT-DSL.md` (the illustrative `jab`/`kick`/`roundhouse` examples →
   the canonical Japanese ids; deferred since S1) + `docs/DESIGN.md` (§P7 arsenal — mark C9 done).
4. **Fold in the deferred line-365 hardening**: a `runFight`/`sim` test that a fighter knocked DOWN
   the same tick it lands a cancelable hit does NOT cancel-attack while prone (kills the `sim.ts:365`
   `f.state.kind === "attacking"` survivor; reachable via a mutual same-tick connect+knockdown).

The session-resolved defaults (Japanese ids, additive `scoreByBand?`, runtime gate, per-slice
find-gaps) hold throughout. When S7 merges, **C9 is complete** — delete this tracker (per the
planning workflow; the record lives in PRs #67–#73 + git history).
